# eccerobo muscle

## eccerobo
This is part of eccerobo project- one-man effort to create a scrap-yard robot, inspired by crayon sketch of a very hairy monkey in an ill-fitting tunic.

## muscle
*muscle* is what makes the robot look alive. It is responsible for driving motors. Uses freemodbus as an interface to the external world.
